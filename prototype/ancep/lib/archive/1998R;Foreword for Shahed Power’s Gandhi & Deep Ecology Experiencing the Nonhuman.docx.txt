Foreword for Shahed Power’s Gandhi & Deep Ecology: Experiencing the
Nonhuman Environment

Arne Naess

Shahed Ahmed Power’s Gandhi & Deep Ecology: Experiencing the Nonhuman
Environment is an important work in many ways. In great, convincing
details it tells about the young Gandhi’s remarkable closeness to
animals and the environment, and his early fondness of playing outdoors,
liking and enjoying nature. All through his life Gandhi had a strong
feeling of responsibility both for human and nonhuman living beings.
Shahed Ahmed Power has gone through the 90 volume Collected Works of
Mahatma Gandhi, and all biographical literature in order to obtain a
true picture of Gandhi’s attitudes and their development throughout his
life.

Among the people to whom Gandhi has been a source of life-long
inspiration, very few, if any, have known about his feelings for nature
and insistence that we can and should respect all living beings,
including snakes and scorpions.

It is a fairly commonly held view that philosophers and ecologists in
the West who believe their views to be in harmony with emminent
personalities of the East are more or less mistaken. In fact, that they
underestimate the difference. It is encouraging that the author of this
very readable text belongs to those who think we Westerners are capable,
to some extent, to understand the environmental message of Gandhi.
