The 8 points of the Deep Ecology Movement

Arne Naess

1. Every living being has value in itself, a value that is independent
of its usefulness for humans.

2. Richness and diversity of life on Earth have value in themselves.

3. Humans do not have the right to diminish the richness and diversity
except to satisfy vital needs.

4. It would be good for humans if they were fewer, and very good for the
nonhumans.

5. The interference of humans in the ecosystems is excessive and must be
reduced.

6. This reduction requires significant changes of technological,
economic and ideological kinds.

7. The ideological change may essentially consist of a higher evaluation
of life quality than standard of living.

8. Those who accept the foregoing points have an obligation to
participate in implementing the necessary changes.
