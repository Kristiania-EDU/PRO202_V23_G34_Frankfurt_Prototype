The 8 points of the deep ecology platform

Arne Naess & George Sessions[1]

(1) The flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth has intrinsic
value. The value of non-human life forms is independent of the
usefulness these may have for narrow human purposes.

(2) Richness and diversity of life forms are values in themselves and
contribute to the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth.

(3) Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to
satisfy vital needs.

(4) Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive,
and the situation is rapidly worsening.

(5) The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a
substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of
non-human life requires such a decrease.

(6) Significant change of life conditions for the better requires change
in policies. These affect basic economic, technological, and ideological
structures.

(7) The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality
(dwelling in situations of intrinsic value) rather than adhering to a
high standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the
difference between big and great.

(8) Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation
directly or indirectly to participate in the attempt to implement the
necessary changes.
