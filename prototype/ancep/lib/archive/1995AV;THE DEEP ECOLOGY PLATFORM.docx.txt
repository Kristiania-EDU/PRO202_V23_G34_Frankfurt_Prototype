THE DEEP ECOLOGY PLATFORM:

AN ALTERNATIVE[1]

1. All life has value in itself, independent of its usefulness to humans

2. Richness and diversity contribute to life's wellbeing and have value
in themselves.

3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to
satisfy vital needs in a responsible way.

4. The impact of humans in the world is excessive and rapidly getting
worse.

5. Human lifestyles and population are key elements of this impact.

6. The diversity of life, including cultures, can flourish only with
reduced human impact.

7. Basic ideological, political, economic and technological structures
must therefore change.

8. Those who accept the foregoing points have an obligation to
participate in implementing the necessary changes and to do so
peacefully and democratically.

[1] This version of the deep ecology platform was formulated by those
attending the Deep Ecology course at Schumacher College, Devon, England,
May 1995.
