The 8 Points of Deep Ecology

1. The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human Life on Earth
have value in themselves (synonyms: intrinsic value, inherent value).
These values are independent of the usefulness of the non-human world
for human purposes.

2. Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of
these values and are also values in themselves.

3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to
satisfy vital needs.

4. The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a
substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of non-
human life requires such a decrease.

5. Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive, and
the situation is worsening.

6. Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic
economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state
of affairs will be deeply different from the present.

7. The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality
(dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an
increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound
awareness of the difference between big and great.

8. Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation
directly or indirectly to try to implement necessary changes.
