The NS-1987 Proposal for a Deep Ecology Platform Formulation

"NS" - Naess and Sessions

1. The welfare and flourishing of human and non-human living beings has
value in itself. The value of the non-human beings is independent of its
usefulness to humans.

2. Richness and diversity of living beings has value in itself.

3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity

except to satisfy vital human needs.

4. The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a
substantial decrease of the human population. The

flourishing non-human life requires such a decrease.

5. Present human interference with the non-human world is

excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.

6. Policies must therefore be changed. Theses policies affect

basic economic, technological, and ideological structures.

The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different

from the present.

7. The appreciation of a high quality of life will supercede

that of a high standard of living

8. Those who accept the foregoing points have an obligation

to try to contribute directly or indirectly to the imple-

mentation of necessary changes.
